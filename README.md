# Hi!My name is Denis Skvortsov.
I am a quality control automation engineer.
My working tools are cypress and javascript (typescript).
Here I post my works that I write in my free time in order to learn the language and the instrument perfectly.
As an example for testing, I use the website apple.com for writing e2e tests
